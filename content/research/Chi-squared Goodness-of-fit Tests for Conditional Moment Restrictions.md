We propose testing conditional moment restrictions (CMRs) using Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) testing procedures. After partitioning the data into cells, $\chi^2$ tests assess whether the discrepancy between the observed means of a generalized residual with the expected vectors of zeroes, under the null, within each cell arose by chance. This is equivalent to test regression specifications by comparing the average response variable with the expected mean under the null within each cell. In contrast to existing omnibus procedures, $\chi^2$ tests offer straightforward implementation and exhibit a standard limit null distribution, ensuring accurate size. To enhance the power of the tests, we propose different partitioning algorithms that leverage information about the null hypothesis and, if specified, the alternative hypotheses. We show that even when the partition depends on the data, the tests limit null distribution remains standard. Montecarlo simulations show the good performance of the $\chi^2$ tests compared to omnibus proposals, particularly in high-dimensional environments and against high-frequency alternatives."
