Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) tests are proposed for assessing the specification of regression models or general conditional moment restrictions (CMR). The data is partitioned based on explanatory variables into several cells, and the $\chi^2$ tests evaluate whether the difference between the observed average of the dependent variable and its expected value under the model specification, within each cell, arises by chance. In contrast to existing omnibus procedures, $\chi^2$ tests are pivotal and fairly insensitive to the curse of dimensionality. The computation of statistics is straightforward and does not require bootstrapping or smoothing techniques. Importantly, the test asymptotic properties are invariant to sample-dependent partitions, allowing for the preference of certain alternatives with a suitable partition choice. A Monte Carlo study provides evidence of the good performance of $\chi^2$ tests compared to omnibus approaches implemented using bootstrap techniques, particularly in high-dimensional settings. An empirical application regarding returns to education of black people in the US complements our finite sample study.
