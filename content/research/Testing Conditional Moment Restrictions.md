This paper proposes $\chi^2$ tests for assessing the specification of regression models or general conditional moment restrictions (CMR). The data is partitioned based on the explanatory variables into several cells, and the $\chi^2$ tests evaluate whether the difference between the observed average of the dependent variable and its expected value under the model specification, within each cell, arises by chance. In contrast to existing omnibus procedures, $\chi^2$ tests are asymptotically pivotal and fairly insensitive to the curse of dimensionality. The computation of statistics is straightforward and does not require bootstrapping or smoothing techniques. Importantly, the asymptotic properties of the test are invariant to sample-dependent partitions, which can be chosen to favor certain alternatives. A Monte Carlo study provides evidence of the good performance of $\chi^2$ tests using samples of small or moderate size compared with existing omnibus alternatives, particularly in high-dimensional settings. An empirical application regarding returns to education of African American students in the US complements our finite sample study.
