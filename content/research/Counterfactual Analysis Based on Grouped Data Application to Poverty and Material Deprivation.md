We propose to estimate the counterfactual decomposition of distributional statistics using aggregated data. The counterfactual estimation is a two-step procedure: first, we aggregate the data, and then we evaluate a mean (or regression) within each group, re-weighting them to account for the group's composition relative to a reference population. Our approach enables a \textit{path-independent} detailed decomposition, highlighting the contributions of each group and characteristic. We recommend using a data-driven method to create the groups. The estimator constructed in this manner can handle challenging settings characterized by numerous non-ordered characteristics and data sparsity. We apply the newly proposed methodology to decompose the Great Recession's effects on Spain's poverty indices. The results suggest that variations in composition were the primary driver of the increase in poverty rates. While labor market disruptions pushed the rates higher, demographic changes and migratory movements had the opposite effect.
