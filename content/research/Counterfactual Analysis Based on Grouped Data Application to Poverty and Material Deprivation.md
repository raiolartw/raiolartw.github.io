We propose to estimate the counterfactual decomposition of distributional statistics
using aggregated data. The counterfactual estimation is a two-step procedure: first,
we aggregate the data; then, we evaluate a mean (or a regression) in each group and
re-weight them for the groups' composition of a reference population. Our approach
allows for a path-independent detailed decomposition, highlighting the contributions
of each group and each characteristic. We propose using a data-driven method to
form the groups. The estimator built in this way can deal with troublesome settings
characterized by numerous non-ordered characteristics and data sparsity. We apply
the newly proposed methodology to decompose the great recession effects on poverty
indices in Spain. The results suggest that composition variations were the main
driver of the rise in poverty rates. While labor market perturbation pushed up the
rates, demographic variations and migratory movements acted in the opposite sense.
