      <description>We propose inferences on the counterfactual mean: the mean of some population outcome, assuming that the related characteristics are distributed according to the distribution of another population. The purpose is to compare the mean of an outcome in two populations, holding constant other related factors that may distort the comparison. Once the data is partitioned into a number of classes, the counterfactual mean is identified as the weighted sum of the outcome conditional expectation in one population, given that the related characteristics take values in each class, with weights the probability that the characteristics take values in each class in the other population.</description>

      <description>While the literature on grouped patterns in panel data analysis has received significant attention, little to no results are available on pretesting grouped patterns. In this paper, we show that available tools for testing slope homogeneity in panels can be used for this purpose. We provide local power analysis and highlight important limitations of the available testing frameworks. A short Monte Carlo study supports our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Testing Conditional Moment Restrictions: A Partitioning Approach</title>

      <description>This paper proposes $\chi^2$-type tests for assessing the specification of regression models or general conditional moment restrictions. The data is partitioned according to the explanatory variables into several cells, and the tests evaluate whether the difference between the observed average of the dependent variable and its expected value under the model specification arises by chance. In contrast to existing omnibus procedures, $\chi^2$ tests are asymptotically pivotal and fairly insensitive to the curse of dimensionality.</description>
